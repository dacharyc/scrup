Scrup, which stands for Screenshot Update, is a program designed 
to let you know when you need to update screenshots in technical 
documentation.

To use Scrup:
___
Create a screenshot inventory:
- Input the URL of a screenshot you want to track;
- Tell Scrup where to look for visual diffs for that screenshot.

ScrUp checks for visual diffs every night.

When ScrUp sees a change to a page that maps to a screenshot,
you'll get an alert.

ScrUp is written in Python 3.
